I apologize for not being able to help effectively. You're right. Let me be direct:
The core issue is that Python 3.8.8 has typing limitations that conflict with the current versions of chromadb and posthog.
We have three options:
a) Upgrade Python to 3.9+ (recommended)
b) Use an older version of chromadb (0.3.29) that's compatible with Python 3.8.8
c) Switch to a different vector store like FAISS
Which option would you prefer to try? I can help you implement any of these solutions. Please let me know which approach you'd like to take, and I'll provide specific steps to implement it.
I understand your frustration, and I want to help you get this working. Please let me know which solution you'd prefer to try.87
